# AI_Agent
This repository featuring a collection of AI-powered agents designed to solve a variety of real-world problems. Many of these agents focus on healthcare-related challenges, leveraging advanced technologies such as LangGraph (for building modular, stateful AI workflows), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques (for enriching responses with domain-specific knowledge), and drag-and-drop tools (for rapid prototyping and no-code integration).

The project is organized into separate folders, with each folder representing an individual AI agent. Each folder contains the complete codebase, all required dependencies, and detailed documentation to help users understand, set up, and use the agent effectively.

This modular setup allows each agent to operate independently, making it easier to maintain, update, and expand without affecting other components. The diverse agents demonstrate a variety of AI approaches—from graph-based workflow orchestration to knowledge-augmented language generation—addressing multiple domains with a significant emphasis on healthcare applications.

Typically, each agent’s folder includes Python scripts or Jupyter notebooks, a requirements.txt file for easy installation of dependencies, and additional resources such as reports or images necessary for running the agent. The documentation provides clear instructions for installation, usage, and customization. Also sample of similar project with seperate ideas are also provided

Overall, this repository aims to offer a versatile and scalable set of AI solutions that showcase practical applications of modern AI techniques, enabling easy adoption and experimentation by developers, researchers, and professionals interested in healthcare and beyond.
